Mineral Classification with Deep Learning

This repository contains code for a deep learning project focused on classifying minerals using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The project aims to develop a model capable of accurately distinguishing between different types of minerals based on images.

Overview

Mineral classification is an important task in geology and material science, facilitating mineral identification and characterization. Traditional methods rely on manual inspection and analysis, which can be time-consuming and subjective. By leveraging deep learning techniques, one can automate and improve the mineral classification process.

Previous TensorFlow-based Model

Before transitioning to PyTorch, I developed a mineral classification model using TensorFlow, a popular deep learning framework. The TensorFlow-based model utilized a custom CNN architecture and achieved competitive performance on the mineral classification task.

Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of a diverse collection of mineral images, including Quartz, Malachite, Biotite, Bornite, Chrysocolla, Muscovite, and Pyrite. The dataset comprises a total of 5640 images, with each mineral category represented by a varying number of samples.

The dataset is divided into training and test sets, allowing for model training, validation, and evaluation.

PyTorch-based Model

In the pursuit of further improving mineral classification performance, I transitioned to PyTorch, another powerful deep learning framework known for its flexibility and ease of use. The PyTorch-based model employs a similar CNN architecture as the TensorFlow model but benefits from PyTorch's features and capabilities.

Training and Evaluation

Similar to the TensorFlow-based model, the PyTorch model is trained using the training dataset and evaluated using the validation dataset. During training, key metrics such as loss and accuracy to assess the model's performance are monitored. Techniques such as early stopping to prevent overfitting and ensure optimal generalization were also employed.

Once training is complete, I evaluated the PyTorch model on a separate test dataset to obtain a final assessment of its performance.

Results

Both the TensorFlow-based and PyTorch-based models achieve competitive performance on the test dataset, demonstrating their ability to accurately classify minerals based on images. Detailed performance metrics and visualizations are provided to illustrate the models' performance and behavior.

Usage
