# Mineral Classification with Deep Learning

## Overview

Mineral classification is an important task in geology and material science, facilitating mineral identification and characterization. Traditional methods rely on manual inspection and analysis, which can be time-consuming and subjective. By leveraging deep learning techniques, one can automate and improve the mineral classification process.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of a diverse collection of mineral images, including Quartz, Malachite, Biotite, Bornite, Chrysocolla, Muscovite, and Pyrite. The dataset comprises a total of 5640 images, with each mineral category represented by a varying number of samples. It is divided into training and test sets, allowing for model training, validation, and evaluation.

## PyTorch-based Model

A powerful deep learning framework known for its flexibility and ease of use. The PyTorch-based model employs a CNN architecture and benefits from PyTorch's features and capabilities.

## Training and Evaluation

The PyTorch model is trained using the training dataset and evaluated using the validation dataset. During training, key metrics such as loss and accuracy to assess the model's performance are monitored. Techniques such as early stopping to prevent overfitting and ensure optimal generalization were also employed.

After 25 epochs of training, the PyTorch model achieved a validation loss of 0.4891.

Once training is complete, the PyTorch model is evaluated on a separate test dataset to obtain a final assessment of its performance.

## Results

The PyTorch-based model achieved a validation loss of 0.4891 after 25 epochs, indicating good convergence. Detailed performance metrics and visualizations are provided to illustrate the model's performance and behavior on the test dataset.

## Future Work

- Explore additional data augmentation techniques, model architectures, and hyperparameter tuning to further enhance classification performance.
- Investigate ensemble learning methods to combine predictions from multiple models for improved robustness and accuracy.
- Deploy the trained model as part of a web application or mobile app for real-world use.
